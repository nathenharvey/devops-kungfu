              <li> Wushu calls this the 'basics', but it involves a lot of pushups, and there isn't a lot of pushups in devops
              <li> This includes a definition of DevOps
              <li> The forms we use - the actual things we practice, that try and re-enforce and bolster our principles
              <li> The application - the use of those forms in our actual situation
              <li> These three things are the evolutionary arc of your practice - in the beginning, you learn from others
              <li> As you grow, you will use the forms others have used to learn about the deeper meaning and philosophy
              <li> The more you apply them in practice, the less reliant on the forms you will be - it all just becomes the natural flow
              <li> Leading you, and anyone else, to be where those of us with already strong Kung Fu are - uniquely suited to our task
              <li> (It's not about whether you are good at it - it's about the soul of our kung fu)
